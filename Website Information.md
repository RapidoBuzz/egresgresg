### Website
This folder contains all the files that we use on our website. It is pure for documentation purposes, and when we update the website, those changes will be visible here too. We

 - Explain who we are, and what we do;
 - Like this repo, document things;
 - Publish news like events etc;
 - Give information about general stuff
 - More yet to come, we will try to update this list when new things are added.
